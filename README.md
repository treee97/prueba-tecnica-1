# Technical Test for REACT

I followed the instructions from the README on this [repo](https://github.com/chedoc/prueba-tecnica-react-developer) It's in spanish.

I used Typescript, React-router-dom, Tailwind and Vite to create the files.
Data is being fetched correctly although this test had a hardcoded json.
The app doesn`t look great because I mainly focused on getting the functionality done heh.

## Things I still have to do
- Unit tests
- Use Redux
- Error handling
- Probably more stuff
